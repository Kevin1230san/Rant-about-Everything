Early Life
Kevin Stewart was born on February 25, 2000, in Toronto, Ontario, to late Baby Boomer parents—a British-born mother and a Canadian father—making him a cusp Generation Z kid with a foot in the 20th century. At age one, his family moved to a townhouse in Thornhill, Vaughan, near Bathurst Street and Steeles Avenue West, where he’s lived ever since in the William Lyon MacKenzie Housing Co-operative. His parents split when he was young; his father moved into a basement room in Toronto, leaving Kevin primarily raised by his mother, a forklift driver turned cashier. Growing up, Kevin was a solitary kid, shaped by a pre-smartphone world of flip phones and dial-up vibes, thanks to his parents’ staunch anti-technology stance. Diagnosed with high-functioning autism at 10, he faced speech challenges and social isolation, compounded by a family dynamic where emotional support was scarce. His grandfather’s occasional physical discipline—like a smack to the head around 2008 or 2010—left lingering scars, while his parents’ restraint from such punishment didn’t translate to warmth.
Education
Kevin’s school years were a patchwork of moves and struggles. He started kindergarten in 2005 at Westminster Public School in Thornhill, then shifted to Wilshire Elementary for grades 1-3, Rosedale Heights for part of grade 4, and Willowbrook Public School from late grade 4 through grade 8 (graduating 2014). High school at Thornlea Secondary School spanned 2014-2019, where he clashed with peers like Samantha and Ben, fueling his sense of alienation. Post-graduation, he joined the PEAK Program at the Promenade Mall (2019-2021), tailored for autistic adults, finishing at 21 during the COVID-19 shift to hybrid learning. His academic path reflects resilience but also a growing bitterness toward a world he felt misunderstood him.
YouTube Journey
Kevin stumbled into YouTube on February 24, 2015, at 14, launching his main channel, Kevin Stewart, with no grand ambitions—just two GTA IV clips. Sporadic uploads followed—GTA V gameplay, school shenanigans, Angry Grandpa reposts—until 2021, when anime girl drowning videos sparked a meteoric rise. From December 2021, his channel ballooned, hitting 1,000 subscribers by September 3, 2022, and peaking at 4.8 million views and 8,700 subs between November 2022 and April 2023. Live streams (RDR 2, WWE 2K22, Angry Grandpa reactions) and niche content fueled this growth, but the Copyright Strike War in April 2023—triggered by Galithrania and Reds MMD striking his videos—cratered it. Two strikes, a fake lawyer stunt, and a hiatus later, he returned in June 2023 with AI content, finally monetizing on February 1, 2024—only for it to pause in March over ID verification woes tied to his parents’ tech aversion. As of mid-2024, he’s on indefinite hiatus, though a February 8, 2025, video (Rants and Longings) and a birthday stream hint at flickers of activity. His John Marston channel (November 18, 2022) rants via AI, while Momo Kawashima (June 20, 2021) mixes gaming and oddball AI stories, both less prominent but active in his orbit.
Work and Finances
Since around 2020 or 2021, Kevin’s worked 3-4 hours weekly at Sobeys on Sundays, earning $16-$17.20/hour (cut from 4 to 3 hours in late 2024). With ODSP and government cheques, he nets a modest income—enough for groceries but not independence. Living rent-free with his mother keeps him afloat, though her threats to kick him out loom large. His dream of buying a smartphone, bike, or car is perpetually stalled by parental control over his debit card and life choices.
Personality and Beliefs
Kevin’s a walking paradox: a self-described “world-famous ranting machine” with a no-bullshit, rage-fueled exterior masking a yearning for peace, love, and validation. His rants—laced with colorful insults, vulgar slurs, and unfiltered bile—target everything from YouTube to technology, smoking, entitled drivers, and societal hypocrisy. Autism shapes his worldview; he’s cynical about a world he feels mocks and sidelines him, yet he craves connection, often fantasizing about a Japanese woman as his savior. He’s anti-tech in rhetoric (blaming it for societal rot) but desperate to join the 21st century, clashing with his parents’ 1960s mindset. Heavy metal (Sabaton, Nightwish) and maritime history (Titanic, USS Enterprise) soothe him, while his dark impulses—dreams of violence, drowning fetishes—war with his self-proclaimed kindness and tolerance.
Personal Struggles
Kevin’s life is a pressure cooker: mental health crises (dark thoughts since April 2024), family tension (evicted briefly in 2024, mother in a psych ward), and social isolation (no friends since high school). His autism fuels impulsivity—like punching a Union Station fire alarm in 2024 or tweeting a fake Taylor Swift concert threat in November 2024, nearly landing him in legal hot water. Health-wise, he’s 260 pounds, battling a sweet tooth and fast food habits, with fleeting gym efforts (GoodLife Fitness, 2024-early 2025). Loneliness gnaws at him; he’s never kissed or dated, haunted by lost connections (Samantha, Tina) and a craving for intimacy he channels into anime fantasies (Mio Sakamoto, Momo Kawashima).
Controversies
Kevin courts chaos online: the Copyright Strike War (fake lawsuits, threats), bot-driven comment campaigns (accusing MMV Water of crimes), and banned accounts (Twitter, DeviantArt) for spicy content. His Rant about Everything blog and UtubeHits antics stir hate, with detractors labeling him racist, sexist, or worse—pedophile—over past rants, though he insists it’s venting, not truth. He revels in controversy, dreaming of infamy as the “king of controversy,” yet fears it’ll bury him.
Current State (March 4, 2025)
At 25, Kevin’s at a crossroads. His YouTube empire teeters—18,000+ subs but dwindling views, on hiatus since mid-2024 save sporadic uploads. Sobeys grinds him down, his mother’s threats loom, and mental health services (CAMH, YSSN) fail him. He’s a volatile mix of rage, despair, and hope, clinging to dreams of freedom (a smartphone, a car, a dog) and love (a Japanese soulmate), all while wrestling a world he calls a “flaming bag of shit.” Whether he rises as a ranting legend or implodes remains unwritten.
