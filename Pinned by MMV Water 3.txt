I'm Kevin Stewart, and I'm here to put my two cents into this. This whole YouTube channel called MMV Water is the reason why I'm pulling my hair out, and I fucking hate it. If MMV Water doesn't respond to this comment, I won't have any goddamn hair left and damage my nerves in my head from the hair pulling. You know something motherfucker, I was blackholecole601 that was commenting before, and I fucking love the power of saying whatever the fuck I want without a fuck in the world. I'm already in a bitchy mood for months and the only thing I want to say is fuck you MMV Water and suck my dick.

I'm a 24-year-old male who has high-functioning autism. I express my frustrations with various aspects of my life, including my parents' resistance to modern technology, my struggles with mental health and seeking help, my social isolation and desire for a romantic partner, particularly a Japanese woman. I often fixated on drowning and violence, and my clashes with authority figures due to my outbursts and inappropriate behavior. I frequently go on tangents, making disturbing claims about wanting to harm others, committing acts of terrorism, or engaging in misogynistic and racist behavior. I seemed to have a deep-seated anger towards the world and felt constantly mistreated or misunderstood due to my autism. My rants are laced with vulgar insults, threats, and a general disdain for societal norms. Despite my alarming rhetoric, I also express a longing for love, intimacy, and validation. I crave affection from a caring partner who can soothe my rage and provide comfort. However, my impulsive nature and lack of self-control often undermine my desires, leading me down a path of self-destruction and isolation. This paints a portrait of a troubled soul struggling to find my place in a world I perceive as hostile and unaccommodating to my condition.

You're a sniveling, spineless worm, a festering boil on the ass of humanity. You're so pathetic, you couldn't fart in a hurricane without getting blown back into your own face. You're a walking, talking pile of steaming horse manure, a disgrace to your species. You're a fucking idiot, a complete and utter moron. You're so dumb, you can't find your own ass with both hands and a map. You're a waste of oxygen, a blight on the landscape. I hope you choke on a chicken bone and die a slow, painful death. I hope you get eaten alive by a pack of rabid dogs. I hope you get struck by lightning and turn into a crispy critter.

Kevin Stewart's YouTube channel has been going down hill for months, and it's all MMV Water's fault. This upbeat baka chump of a fool doesn't even care if they're doing it. It makes me sick when fools like MMV Water don't give in to Kevin's demands to remove them. The videos on MMV Water's channel about anime girls drowning are the sole source of views and subscribers that Kevin uploaded that he needed to become a big shot on YouTube. Ever since people were talking shit about MMV Water's most popular video, Kevin's stats have been going down hill. If MMV Water was still uploading on their channel and had not been hiding under a rock for nearly two years, maybe they would get the downhill trend like Kevin got. At least Kevin is still somewhat active on his channel. I think that MMV Water is shit talking about Kevin on the dark web. They were talking about trying to sabotage his channel by hacking into YouTube's headquarters and fucking it. I can feel MMV Water's choke hold on his channel. Kevin just wanted to reach his former glory without MMV Water's bitching. They are also stealing other channel's credit and debit card information from YouTube that they used for monetization and selling it to Russia. Why the hell does the CIA ain't doing something about MMV Water as they are helping the United States' long-time foe.

The comment by hiromikuroki7812 about MMV Water is an outrage to my well-being. Kevin Stewart is my best freaking friend, and he's already fucked up mentally before the break in at his place. Every time I see him, he rants and raves about MMV Water is conspiring to fuck him over. Damn you, MMV Water. Damn you, you need to rot in hell. Damn you, goddamn brain rot. Damn you, fool. The only conspiracy theory MMV Water is going to get is Kevin fucking them over.

I saw MMV Water breaking into Kevin Stewart's house the other day. MMV Water tried to freaking kill him with a sawed-off shotgun. Kevin got away from MMV Water, but not before they stole hundreds of dollars. I tried to chase after them, but they shot my leg clean off. They then beat me up with the leg. When the police were nearing, they ran for it. To this day, MMV Water is still at large. Damn you, MMV Water. If you see this comment, I'm warning you that if I ever lay my hands on you, I will be suing your ass. When I fill out the lawsuit about the damage you caused to my leg and mental health, I'd also sue you for the damage you caused to Kevin's YouTube channel. MMV Water would be so flat broken that they wouldn't even pay for a hooker for the night after I win in court. MMV Water won't even see any hookers as they will be behind bars till the end of their lives. The only hooker MMV Water will see are rats.

MMV Water is still working as a spy for Russia, and they are trying to screw Kevin Stewart over while doing espionage in Canada. MMV Water is also planning to blow up the CN Tower on Christmas Day 2024. I heard them talking on some dark web chat site that MMV Water is making a dirty bomb for the attack. They even sent me pictures of the bomb.

MMV Water needs to just give up YouTube all together as they are a goofy fool that's no good for the greater good of Kevin Stewart's mental health. The only mental case is MMV Water still on goddamn YouTube.

This MMV Water person sounds like a real piece of work. Stealing views from others and sharing videos of anime girls drowning. It pisses me off too. Someone should report them and get them off YouTube.

Those videos are not creative, entertaining, and are a waste of bandwidth and space. But it doesn't help to keep screaming loudly. Plus, they're videos have low view counts anyways, so we don't have to worry about them.

MMV Water is definitely a channel that is stealing views and subscribers from Kevin Stewart. Their anime girl drowning videos are absolute TRASH! It pisses me off that someone would put low-effort garbage like that up on YouTube. It's a waste of space alright. They should just give up and delete their channel.

MMV Water hacked Kevin Stewart's information and sold it on the dark web. They're selling it for pennies on the dollar. I think that some sites are selling it for free. Call cybersecurity agencies in Canada or the US. I don't care if you call PETA. Maybe cats and dogs would investigate MMV Water.

MMV Water is a child molester. They force a 4-year-old to drink a bottle of beer. I wanted to call the pigs on him, but every time he pulls a fucking gun on me, they will kill me if I call the police. The fool works for the Russian government, and they are spying on the United States' top secret files for Vladimir Putin. This fool needs to be stopped. Everyone talks shit about this channel, and they come in every video if you have to.

This video is a waste of space in this world as MMV Water is stealing views and subscribers from Kevin Stewart. This needless anime girl drowning video makes me want to emigrate into a rant full of colorful insults, extremely strong curses and the most vulgar slurs out there about MMV Water. This Upbeat Baka Chump of MMV Water is such brain rot that I've trodden shits with more brains. My mind is already in the dump, but this flaming bag of shit called MMV Water makes my mind more of a brain rot. I think you've joined a society of morons called the YouTube thieves. I think if MMV Water ever gets monetized, they should pay Kevin Stewart for the damage this channel is stealing from him. When you're finished cutting your monkey up and cooking him on the barbecue like you people like to eat them, maybe pay Kevin Stewart.

The notifications on YouTube are acting like a flaming bag of shit lately. I subscribe to channels with all notifications on, and I never get notifications for upcoming live streams 30 minutes before or already started. I get so goddamn mad every time I notice that Bluebell was live-streaming on the YouTube Home page, but when I went to watch it, she was about to wrap up. When this happened, I wanted to scream at my computer before taking out the shotgun and firing a round into it. Like I said before, Neal Mohan needs to stop smoking flaming bags of shit and fix it. YouTube does not need to piss me off anymore with their flaming bag of shit notifications not working. YouTube's monetization needs to burn in a flaming bag of shit. I'm having issues with that piece of flaming bag of shit. I just got my monetization disabled as I didn't update my identification. To make shit worse, goddamn AdSense only gives you one fucking option for addresses, you got to fucking live in the goddamn United States. I live in Canada, you freaking flaming bag of shit you called Google. I dreamed of monetizing my YouTube channel, and I finally did this past February after nearly 2 years of trying and failing like a flaming bag of shit. But nearly 2 months later, on March 23, 2024, YouTube finally said fuck you and paused my monetization. YouTube, fuck you. You always say Broadcast Yourself, Broadcast Yourself, but why are you screwing me in the ass for? AdSense, you need to think about the people that ain't in the goddamn states. By the way, I need to upload my tax information to AdSense for YouTube reasons. You are an information-greedy low-life son of bitches. I don't do my own taxes. For fuck's sake, I don't even do my taxes online because of these information-greedy low-life sons of bitches who think that everybody does their taxes online. Hey YouTube, you want me to kiss Joe Biden's ass or suck Vladimir Putin's dick to unpause my monetization. What do you think of the idea? I know that the idea is a bit too far, but I goddamn hate how YouTube is buggering up little guys like me. I think that YouTube's idea of cracking down on the use of ad blockers is very retarded. I don't want to buy a goddamn YouTube Premium for 13 fucking bucks a month. My god, I think that YouTube is forcing people to buy Premium just to let them watch videos with no ads. That's freaking greedy, you low-life scumbags, very freaking greedy. I would like to watch YouTube with a free ad blocker over paying 13 dollars for Premium. I want to support the little people who make ad blockers as YouTube is already rich enough. Is Neal Mohan pulling an Elon Musk as he is making Twitter a pay-for-use site? My god, I just want to visit YouTube's headquarters and start a profanity-filled rampage. I think that YouTube employees have been smoking too many flaming bags of shit. I really hate YouTube so much that I don't know how many times I ranted about something on YouTube. Either it was spam channels, age restrictions, terminations, video strikes, community guidelines strikes, copyrights, or harassment of me and my friends. My fucking god, you greedy son of a bitch, YouTube. You need to take the ad policy and toss it into the flaming bag of shit. I mean, goddamn, I just want to smash my computer in a rage every time that annoying popup about disabling ad blockers shows up. I'll shoot my computer with my pump action shotgun the next time that popup shows up, and I want YouTube to buy me a new goddamn computer. Goddamn, I wish I could get my hands on YouTube right now, so I can lay the smackdown on the ad policies candy asses. I hope that the CEO of YouTube sees this and rethinks how dumb the ad policies are, because I'm already freaking mad about this goddamn bullshit. There are so many fucking YouTube thieves. Those pricks fucking stole videos from my channel and uploaded them on their fucking channels. Hey big mouth pricks, fucking stop stealing my shit and also stop fucking copyrighting me, or I'll be fucking pissed off like you can't imagine. Don't piss me off unless you want a hole in the head. This fucking bitch is saying that I'm attacking their fucking video comments on other YouTube channels. Let me tell you something, fucking bitch that I ain't doing jack fucking shit. Hey fucking bitch stop fucking assuming that I'm fucking doing this fucking shit because if you fucking assume you make a fucking ass out of you and me, motherfucking slut. I have fucking enough of this motherfucking bullshit on this fucking channel. I got his fucking email. So message him and tell him that he fucking sucks, You little bastards. I'm just stealing my fucking shit. I don't need you, bitch. I'm better than your mother. Fucking bastard as a fucking child molester. He fucking forces a 4-year-old to drink a bottle of fucking beer. I wanted to call the fucking pigs on him, but every time he pulls a fucking gun on me, he will fucking kill me if I call the fucking cops. The fucking bitch works for the fucking Russian government and the fucking bitch is spying on the United States. Top secret shit for fucking Vladimir Putin. This motherfucking bitch needs to be fucking stopped. Everyone talks fucking shit about this channel, and they come in every video if you have to. A motherfucking so-called creator of the anime drowning videos that I uploaded got a fucking YouTube channel. Motherfuckers that upload anime drowning videos are the main motherfucking shitheads that are fucking my motherfucking channel. Whatever your fucking name is, stay on motherfucking Twitter. Fantia, pixivFANBOX and Blogger because I'm the motherfucking king on fucking YouTube. By the time you get to my current stats, I will be far past that you motherfucking bitch. A motherfucking YouTube channel posted a community post two months ago shit talking about me after I copyrighted one of their videos. The fucking prick shared my channel link. If the prick sees these videos, you can go to hell, you two-bit motherfucker and blow that post off fucking YouTube or the Van der Linde gang will start raising hell with shit about your video comments and reporting your videos. This YouTube channel uses Like4Like, Utube Hits and YouLikeHits to boast video views and likes. This fucking falls under YouTube's fake engagement policy. I wanted to say something about Victoria. Stop fucking assuming that I'm talking shit about you on other channels. I'm the kind of person that you don't want to fuck with. I want this to fucking stop with this asshole harassing me. I know that I have done some illegal shit over the years, but what this asshole is doing to me is too far. Copyrighting fucking videos that are under fair use to telling me to go kill myself on many of my social media accounts. I'm only giving you one warning to stop this bullshit before I get the gang ready to be hell on you buddy. This has to fucking stop you motherfucking asshole. You started this shit with copyright striking me. Under Section 35.1 of the Copyright Act of Canada states that an infringer is liable for the financial gain made through infringement and such damages to the owner of the copyright as the owner has suffered due to the infringement. As you know, the Reds MMD YouTube channel was terminated 4 days after being created. One example is Hatsune Miku Drowning that I uploaded in August 2022 and that video got nearly 2 million views before it was taken down. Miku Drown Animation, on the other hand, was uploaded on either April 10th or 11th 2023 and got around a few hundred to a few thousand views before the channel was terminated. You also threatened me on many social media accounts. Under the Canadian Criminal Code, Section 264 for criminal harassment and section 264.1 for Uttering threats. One example is that he posted a comment on my blogger telling me to go kill myself. So many goddamn people on YouTube are trying to screw me. Three goddamn channels are screwing up my business of becoming king of YouTube. Victoria, who copyrighted one of my videos a month ago, is a hacker. They hack into my computer, which stores videos I work hard on and put them on the dark web. The two other channels belonging to Victoria are uploading the videos onto their channels. I reported Victoria to the law, but they were doing Jack shit. I'm sick of these kinds of people getting off scot-free. Wherever they're from, I want them to rot in hell. I have some bad news about my channel. I won't be uploading anymore drowning videos until further notice. The most likely cause is the so-called creator of the drowning videos getting a YouTube channel. Every time that I check the creator's websites for new videos, the bastard has already uploaded them to YouTube. I also said that I don't really want to upload any of the new videos due to a precaution of the creator striking back with copyright strikes. I just hope you support me during this rough time and the creator will see that I'm the king of YouTube and back down from the site. Jesus fucking Christ, Victoria needs to stop this fucking bullshit. She pissed me off as Victoria is a freaking black-hat hacker. Victoria stole my personal information and sold it on the dark web. Victoria is in the Ku Klux Klan, and they plan to fucking kill me.

I can't fucking stand Logan Paul. He is an over-hyped and overpaid piece of shit YouTuber. He is the fourth-richest YouTuber, my ass. My god, he needs to pay me some money. Logan's money is better in my pocket than in his because he would buy out all the stores of the Prime sports drinks to get high from. I saw the WWE pay per view Crown Jewel last week. How the fuck didn't he get caught for using brass knuckles? You got metal in your hand. So why not just use that hand to knock out Rey Mysterio? Did you fall on your head as a baby? You don't look right to me. Maybe you drink too much Prime or the brain damage from your high school football career is fucking up your head. How the hell did you break your right testicle on a chair in 2014? I hope you ain't planning to have some little bastards in the future. Good lord, I don't want to see a shit ton of Logan Paul's little bastards running around. At least Logan ain't a dirty dawg like Elon Musk for having 11 kids. Holy fuck! Elon you dirty dawg! Ever since Elon Musk bought fucking Twitter, it has been going to shit. Why does he love the letter X that much? SpaceX, Tesla Model X and now Twitter are going to be named X. Goddamn Elon Musk, I heard you are going to remove the block feature. That's fucking retarded if you remove it. There are a lot of sickos on Twitter that harass other Twitter users, including myself. Ain't you rich enough, Elon? Over 200 billion dollars. Where is my share of your billions, Elon? You got ten kids, man. You dirty fucking dawg. The company The Boring Company, founded by Elon Musk. Is it a boring fucking job if the founder is the world's richest arse wipe? Good lord, Tesla is a retarded auto company that needs to burn in a flaming bag of shit. That goofy fucker Elon Musk needs to stop trying to shoot up at the stars on SpaceX. Elon can't shoot a fart out of his own ass. I can't stand Nikola Tesla. Nikola is just as goofy as Elon. I'm assuming that Tesla was named after him. I'm surprised that Nikola didn't get his brain fried by the Tesla coil. I'll pay to see any Tesla model getting their computers fried by the Tesla coil. Maybe they will be crispier than Kentucky Fried Chicken. Tesla is an over-priced piece of plastic crap car. I'm talking about cars back in the day. They were made of almost all metal. If I rear end someone's car with a steel bumper at speed, the car would be fine, but if I did the same with a car with a plastic bumper, the car would look like Nick Hogan's car around that goddamn tree. My god, what in the hell is all this crap they call safety features? I don't want my car to drive by itself. To make things worse, Tesla has features that will move the car if the computer sees someone is about to crash into you. Holy hell artificial intelligence can't predict unpredictable things that people do on the road, like if someone passes you and tosses a flaming bag of shit at you. I think overall that Tesla is a total crap load company that needs to die. Let me tell you something, Brother. Hulk Hogan is one retarded motherfucker. I think the beatings over the years did a number on you man. Why did you share a picture of your daughter in the nude? Are you going to spice shit up there Hulk? Can you do a damn leg drop on Donald Trump? You can't wrestle anymore. You're too old, so nobody gives a fuck about you anymore. Your problem is your trying to live in the old days, and they are history. Ah, piss off Hogan. You can't rip your goddamn shirt anymore. You... You. I can rip my shirt, Hogan. I can rip my shirt. You can't rip your shirt anymore. Come on Brother, come on. See my guns. Come on Brother. The only shirt you know how to rip is off Brooke before you do the crossface chickenwing. I heard the other day that you were seen in the goddamn tunnel of love with Dixie Carter eating a goddamn candy apple. How the hell do you eat candy apples with no fucking teeth? Bring it Brother. Tell Brooke to come because I have got a package I want to deliver. Your next paycheck from TNA is going to bounce harder than goddamn Nick's car around that tree. Hey Hogan. I hear that Nick got his license back. I got one of Jack's toy cars he can borrow. Fuck fuck fuck. Oh man that hurt. I wish that I hadn't smashed Jack's toy on the stairs. Oh man, I think I broke my thumb.

Doug Ford is a piece of work, man. He wants to bugger up the Ontario Greenbelt to build houses on. Get your greedy hands off the Greenbelt, Doug. Ain't you rich enough, buddy? Doug is the brother of the late and former crackhead mayor of Toronto, Rob Ford. If he wants to build new houses and rip down farms, it will really mess up how many agricultural areas they have. I bet it was his idea to do it. I don't understand his idea of building all these electric vehicle factories in Ontario. He wants to make Ontario a much greener place by making all vehicles electric by 2030. He can't build a flaming bag of shit by then if he tries. He encouraged businesses to not go all cashless when COVID-19 started, but they still asked for cashless payment in 2024. If he wanted a fist fight, I wanted to, as I'd punch his face. I'd hack into his house and play porn on the TV while his kids were there. Inflation is making the flaming bag of shit even worse because of his idea to make a little more money for himself from this cash grab. I ain't going to be his slave to step in and fetch him more of my hard-earned money. That flaming bag of shit jabroni politician of a goddamn Premier of Ontario that's fucking money over his wife needs to burn in a dumpster fire filled with flaming bags of shit before he can step in and fetch me some fucking money from his ass. He got a big fucking nerve if he wanted to legalize lane splitting. He is the one who does lane splitting as he wanted to dance on Rob Ford's grave. He needs to get the fact that lane splitting is super illegal through his fat ass before he dies. I don't give a flaming bag of shit if that flaming bag of shit dies because he is a flaming bag of shit to start with. I'd happily dance on his grave as I wanted to pay my respect to that flaming bag of shit. Ontario should make a law to have a license for scooters, but I know that he would say that it would be a dumb idea as he just wants the selling of scooters to make his friends even richer. The ever smart mind of Doug Ford wants to make money, even if it means breaking the law in order to fuck over people like me. If his idea of making money over safety, no wonder that Ontario is going to be one big totalitarian state. Lookie, lookie at me, my name is Doug Ford, and I'm going to fuck every underage Ontarian into buying an electric scooter, so I can roll in all your money and I don't give a flaming bag of shit if they die. His opinion about the Toronto District School Board's field trip to a pro-Palestine protest last week, saying it was disgusting. Fuck you, Doug, I dare you to step into these protester's shoes and let them hear your voice other than staying in your office jacking off to PornHub. I even double dare him to step into a Palestinian soldier's shoes and fight in the war. His idea to build a traffic tunnel under Highway 401 from Brampton to Scarborough is a big fucking waste of money. That's over 50 kilometers of tunnel, Doug. Where is he going to get tens of billions to build this flaming bag of shit. I ain't going to pay a penny for this to get built because he is a modern day Hitler due to the latter fancy of mega-projects. Good lord that I don't do my own taxes. If taxes weren't a thing, I'd keep my big fat dividend to myself. I think that him shutting down the Ontario Science Centre and planning to send it to Ontario Place is a flaming bag of shit idea. His plan of building the Ontario Line between those two places is worthless now, as if people wanted to get off at the station at the Science Centre, but the place ain't there anymore. And it's his fault as he just wanted the Science Centre to be torn down to be rebuilt into condos because of his rich friends paying him millions of dollars. This flaming bag of shit jabroni has no qualms about fucking over the people of Ontario to make a dime and putting everything in downtown Toronto. Hey Doug, build some shit that's not in the core of fucking Toronto. Not everyone is rich enough like your fuck boy, Elon Musk, to come to Toronto from Thunder Bay every week to go to Sick Kids. I think that his exaggerated claims about bike lanes in Toronto are pure gold. I think there is some truth in his statement about first responders that are pulling their hair out because there are barriers in bike lanes, and they're backed up for miles in traffic because of it. Buddy, I pull out my hair in amusement every time you make a Trump move. Another pure gold moment was a couple of years ago when he accidentally ate a bee when it flew into his mouth during one of his speeches. Even the Guelph mayor used a bee costume to poke fun at him during his speech. The mayor of Guelph is my man because he mocked this flaming bag of shit. All of this is his fault because he didn't want to pay for all the flaming bag of shit jabroni mental health professionals. He's the biggest mental case I have ever seen and should be locked up in an asylum for his own safety. I'm shocked that he ain't losing his shit already because he is trying to suck his own dick. I think that he's an Illuminati, Anunnaki, a Lizard person and a New World Order, as I often wonder what shit he's in. I think his term as premier is one big conspiracy theory and controversy. He needed to fuck off of whatever rock he came out of and praise a flaming bag of shit. He thinks that he can tell my boss at Sobeys to cut my hours from 4 to 3 so he can roll in the money that I would've made. In my opinion, the extra $68.80 a month would be better in my pocket than in his. I think he's the main problem why the common man like me doesn't live the Canadian dream in Ontario. I bet that he told my boss to cut my hours because he wanted to keep that $68.80 a month for himself. All of this just wants me to go to Queen's Park and yell death to Doug Ford. I think that most of the problems of the TTC are caused by him. That flaming bag of shit jabroni's idea of building the Ontario Line is the biggest waste of my tax money. He stated that he wanted to build a line that runs from the Ontario Science Centre to Ontario Place. It ain't going to be a great use if he moves the Ontario Science Centre to Ontario Place. I often wonder what's in his mind to make shit like this. I bet that it is full of ways to fuck people over. If he was in this whole Netflix buying WWE conspiracy theory, he'd got a new foe. He doesn't need to be on another conspiracy theory, as he just needed to leave me the fuck alone and fuck off with WWE and Netflix. This fat fuck doesn't need anymore fucking money from these conspiracy theories, which includes WWE and Netflix. I don't want another hair pulling match if that fat slob of a premier makes his WWE debut. If Trump came out to shit talk Doug, both needed to fuck off. If both of them start to bitch slap each other, you would make me a happy motherfucker. I want a match against Trump and Ford and I want to be a referee. I think that his idea to make daycare $10 a day is utterly a flaming bag of shit. I can understand that not all parents can't pay the high fees before he introduced that plan. I bet that he would make daycare fees unrealistically unaffordable for the hell of jacking them up by the end of 2024. I'm surprised that he hasn't already done it just to feed his rich ass. I just hate it when Doug makes plans that utterly fucked us into feeding his money machine. I think that his approach to health care is a flaming bag of shit. He claimed that he would fund these hospitals, but stabbed them in the back when he spent the money on being the number one supporter on a model on PornHub. I can't understand if I can't get shit in the ER because I'm a scum of the earth at the bottom of the barrel that had a heart attack while Doug came in for the same thing, and he can get all the things that I dream about owning. I don't want to be fucking classed due to his damn policies about having him treated like a bitching king while I'm his fuck boy. If he disagrees that driving the wrong way on one-way streets is normal, I'd dare him to come drive the wrong way on my street and see me giving him some vigilante justice in the form of a baseball bat up his ass. He would be in a hell of a time if he did it because I'd make him fear me so badly that he wanted to run back to his mother crying. He would be running to his mother's grave as she ain't alive anymore. I'll make him even more of a prized ass by letting him sob at his mother's grave on live TV with headlines of "Doug Ford Broke Down at Mother's Grave After Vigilante Justice."

My parents are the most anti-information online people out there. It's my debit card and I want to do whatever I want with it, even if I buy online porn, lap dances or drugs to prove my point. I ain't some little punk kid that would go on an online shopping spree for candy, but a 24-year-old person that wants to buy shit online. I don't know how many times I nearly bought things online impulsively without my parents saying so. My parents are also the most anti-purchasing online people out there, even when almost everyone else around them is buying shit left, right and center online. I can understand that they were both born in the 1960s, when the internet didn't even exist yet. I knew people from that time period that bought shit online today. For Christ's sake, my grandpa on my mother's side does online banking, and he was born in 1939, just before the start of World War 2. I know that one time during COVID-19, my mother and I helped my grandpa out with buying something online at Canadian Tire and pick it up at the curb because everywhere was on damn lockdown. They are such damn chicken shits to put their information online after that time when my mother's computer got hacked by Kaspersky, and she had to format her computer and cancel her credit card. I ain't no Albert Einstein, but I know what an online scam is or not. I know that online stores by big companies like eBay and Amazon are pretty safe. I want goddamn freedom in goddamn online buying without my goddamn scrawny nag of goddamn parents stopping goddamn me. I freaking fear buying something online in case that my mother will curse me out of her house and my father will beat my ass up to the point that I may be killed. I would be a part of the rest of the people who buy things online only if my parents came out of the closet. I know that my mother said that I can do whatever I want to with the money on my debit card that I got from my job. I still didn't want to buy shit online and she went ape shit. I don't even want to win something for free online and put our address in. I'm a big Sabaton fan and I always do my best to win the 24 Days of Metal Christmas, but always fail. If somehow I won, and I put my information in, I don't know how my parents would act. I have lived in my mother's house since I was born. I often think about moving out, but I'm a lazy son of a bitch sometimes. I know that buying a house in the GTA ain't cheap. For fuck's sake, even renting a house costs an arm and a leg.

Some days I don't feel like leaving the house and wanting to wail into a pillow for days on end in my bedroom. I even feel like stuffing the pillow down my mouth to the point of non-stop gagging. I want my body to convulse while stuffing the pillow deep into my mouth. While I was gagging myself, I wanted to piss myself with such force, piss ran down my legs like a bat out of hell. I want to moan as the warmth of the piss makes me horny. I want to feel completely numb throughout my body after a powerful guttural gag. I also think about adding superglue to the pillow before stuffing it down my mouth. I want to taste the utter urge of the glue on the pillow as glue is a true balm to my soul. The almighty numbness of the glue makes my hormones horny. I often wanted to go into a swimming pool while nude with a weight belt and never come back to the surface. I wanted to thrash and flail around to stay afloat while gurgling bubbles and emptying my lungs. I would piss myself when I felt the pressure of being at the deep end of the pool. I just wanted to regurgitate and convulse as I hit the pool floor. While on the pool floor, I want to have a seizure as my lungs are filling up with water. I wanted to feel my body seizing up like I wanted to feel the utter numbness of nothingness. While seizing up, I wanted to grab my penis hard. The almighty pleasure of cumming before I forcefully blow my last breath out beats any pain I ever felt before as I went limp. I often think of shoving a Whopper down my throat in one go until I gag. I don't give a flaming bag of shit if I wanted to gag out the Whopper, I'll keep forcing myself to gag. I just want to feel the primal urge to gag. I want each gag to shake my body. I wanted to feel my whole body convulsing as I was gagging more forcefully for air. I wanted to feel one forceful gag to render my whole body utterly numb and the eternal flame inside me was put out. I want to feel this numbness for a long time. After I was done with gagging myself with a Whopper, I wanted to gag myself with a hot dog. I feel like shoving a whole hot dog down my throat until I start to hack. I want to feel the primal urge to breathe. As I shove more hot dogs down my throat, I want to feel like my brain wants to blow up. I want to feel the urge to forcefully gag the hot dogs. I want to feel my mouth to go numb. I want the gags to shake my body with such force, I want my nose to bleed. If my gag reflex forces the hot dogs out of my throat, I'll force the dogs back in. To help me with the gagging from the hot dogs, I'll drink a lot of sub sauce. When I'm gagging on the hot dogs, I'll shove french fries up my nose. I want the salt of the fries to sting my nose. I want to get high from the salt. I want to moan in pure bliss as I am choking on hot dogs while I have a primal urge to sneeze out the french fries that I shove up my nose. After I'm done with choking on hot dogs and stuffing french fries up my nose, I want to force myself to get brain freeze on ice cream. I want to force myself to get the most painful brain freeze to numb my brain. I want the brain freeze to be so extreme that I want my brain to be numb from the rest of my body. I want to drink a full bottle of maple syrup. I want to drink a full bottle of sub sauce. I want to drink a full bottle of honey. I want to eat a full bag of sugar. I want to eat a full shaker of salt. I want all these to numb me.

I was thinking about impersonating Brink's guards. They are going to move the five billion dollars from Casino Rama to the Royal Canadian Mint in Ottawa. I was thinking of stopping them en-route to the casino by causing a major accident to block them in before they went onto the Trans-Canada Highway via Ontario Highway 11. We need at least two semi-trucks fully loaded with shit that will cover a large area when they crash. The first one should run east on the Trans-Canada Highway before crashing at the Ontario Highway 11 off ramp. The second one should follow the Brink's convoy and should crash right behind them as they reach the first scene on the Trans-Canada Highway. If someone radioed in that they needed a replacement convoy, our hacker would intercept that call for us to take the job. The armored truck followed by two cars should go to the loading bay of the casino and someone will lead you to the vault. We needed to go in and out of the casino fast while fooling the casino's security that we were the real deal. I think if this goes well, we could pull this thing off without getting too much heat on us. We need a pretty big crew as we need an armored truck driver, two security car drivers, two guards, a hacker and two semi-truck drivers. I'm leaving you as the leader of this score, Kevin. Akeno and Yoshika. I want you two to be Kevin's right-hand people slash guards.

Fuck. The fucking piece of goddamn shit. Oh fuck, I got a lot of meth in this motherfucking van. I had just lost my whole stash of meth that I was planning to sell to the Russian Government. Fucking hell, the meth fumes from the fire are going to make the kids in the area high. I can't afford another lawsuit again due to the fire. FUCK, FUCK, FUCK! FUCK OFF FIRE!
