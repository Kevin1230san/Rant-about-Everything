 @Kevin1230san  It's a shock hearing something like that from this YouTube thief. I don't care if you have 18000 or no so-called buddies subbing to you, their comments are disturbing and break YouTube's terms and current laws.

I'm a 24-year-old male who has high-functioning autism. I express my frustrations with various aspects of my life, including my parents' resistance to modern technology, my struggles with mental health and seeking help, my social isolation and desire for a romantic partner, particularly a Japanese woman. I often fixated on drowning and violence, and my clashes with authority figures due to my outbursts and inappropriate behavior. I frequently go on tangents, making disturbing claims about wanting to harm others, committing acts of terrorism, or engaging in misogynistic and racist behavior. I seemed to have a deep-seated anger towards the world and felt constantly mistreated or misunderstood due to my autism. My rants are laced with vulgar insults, threats, and a general disdain for societal norms. Despite my alarming rhetoric, I also express a longing for love, intimacy, and validation. I crave affection from a caring partner who can soothe my rage and provide comfort. However, my impulsive nature and lack of self-control often undermine my desires, leading me down a path of self-destruction and isolation. This paints a portrait of a troubled soul struggling to find my place in a world I perceive as hostile and unaccommodating to my condition.

I'm a 24-year-old male with high-functioning autism who uses vulgar language, offensive remarks, and has disturbing thoughts. I express frustration with various aspects of my life, including my parents' restrictions on technology, lack of independence, mental health struggles, and difficulty finding romantic connections. I frequently vent about my hatred for modern technology and my parents' refusal to let me have a smartphone, despite my desire for freedom and access to online services. I also harbor violent and sexually deviant thoughts, such as wanting to harm women, children, and animals. My mental health appears to be deteriorating, as I contemplate suicide, self-harm, and committing acts of violence against others. I often mention past incidents like the Copyright Strike War on YouTube, trashing my home during meltdowns, and lying to my mother about various misdeeds. I also express a longing for validation, intimacy with a Japanese woman, and a sense of purpose in life. However, my disturbing thoughts and actions, coupled with my refusal to seek proper help, paint a concerning picture of a deeply troubled individual struggling to cope with my autism and the modern world.

I'm a 24-year-old with high-functioning autism. I'm a produce clerk at Sobeys and am frustrated with my job. I live in Thornhill, Ontario with my mother. I'm a fan of Sabaton and have a YouTube channel called Kevin Stewart. I was diagnosed with high-functioning autism at the age of 10. I'm 5 feet 10 inches tall and weigh 250 pounds. I feel like I'm being treated like a third-class citizen because of my autism. I have trouble with my speech, and people often don't understand me. I want freedom from the world and to be treated with respect. I'm not happy that my parents won't let me buy things online or get a smartphone. I'm also upset about not being able to drive because my mother won't let me get my driver's license. I'm frustrated with my parents' smoking habits and think that Tesla is an overpriced car company. I would like to get married and have children one day. I'm a fan of anime and have a second YouTube channel called John Marston. I'm struggling with my mental health and have been experiencing a lot of rage. I'm currently trying to get help from mental health services in the Greater Toronto Area. I daydream about having a girlfriend and have an active interest in women. I'm a veteran of the Copyright Strike War and believe I should get benefits for my service.

I wish MMV Water wasn't a coward due to Kevin Stewart and his goons trash commenting about them. As one of Kevin's goons, I'm asking whether MMV Water would just come out of the closet and face the music rather than cutting monkeys up and grilling them on the barbecue.

Kevin Stewart's YouTube channel has been going down hill for months, and it's all MMV Water's fault. This upbeat baka chump of a fool doesn't even care if they're doing it. It makes me sick when fools like MMV Water don't give in to Kevin's demands to remove them. The videos on MMV Water's channel about anime girls drowning are the sole source of views and subscribers that Kevin uploaded that he needed to become a big shot on YouTube. Ever since people were talking shit about MMV Water's most popular video, Kevin's stats have been going down hill. If MMV Water was still uploading on their channel and had not been hiding under a rock for nearly two years, maybe they would get the downhill trend like Kevin got. At least Kevin is still somewhat active on his channel. I think that MMV Water is shit talking about Kevin on the dark web. They were talking about trying to sabotage his channel by hacking into YouTube's headquarters and fucking it. I can feel MMV Water's choke hold on his channel. Kevin just wanted to reach his former glory without MMV Water's bitching. They are also stealing other channel's credit and debit card information from YouTube that they used for monetization and selling it to Russia. Why the hell does the CIA ain't doing something about MMV Water as they are helping the United States' long-time foe.

The comment by hiromikuroki7812 about MMV Water is an outrage to my well-being. Kevin Stewart is my best freaking friend, and he's already fucked up mentally before the break in at his place. Every time I see him, he rants and raves about MMV Water is conspiring to fuck him over. Damn you, MMV Water. Damn you, you need to rot in hell. Damn you, goddamn brain rot. Damn you, fool. The only conspiracy theory MMV Water is going to get is Kevin fucking them over.

I saw MMV Water breaking into Kevin Stewart's house the other day. MMV Water tried to freaking kill him with a sawed-off shotgun. Kevin got away from MMV Water, but not before they stole hundreds of dollars. I tried to chase after them, but they shot my leg clean off. They then beat me up with the leg. When the police were nearing, they ran for it. To this day, MMV Water is still at large. Damn you, MMV Water. If you see this comment, I'm warning you that if I ever lay my hands on you, I will be suing your ass. When I fill out the lawsuit about the damage you caused to my leg and mental health, I'd also sue you for the damage you caused to Kevin's YouTube channel. MMV Water would be so flat broken that they wouldn't even pay for a hooker for the night after I win in court. MMV Water won't even see any hookers as they will be behind bars till the end of their lives. The only hooker MMV Water will see are rats.

MMV Water is still working as a spy for Russia, and they are trying to screw Kevin Stewart over while doing espionage in Canada. MMV Water is also planning to blow up the CN Tower on Christmas Day 2024. I heard them talking on some dark web chat site that MMV Water is making a dirty bomb for the attack. They even sent me pictures of the bomb.

MMV Water needs to just give up YouTube all together as they are a goofy fool that's no good for the greater good of Kevin Stewart's mental health. The only mental case is MMV Water still on goddamn YouTube.

This MMV Water person sounds like a real piece of work. Stealing views from others and sharing videos of anime girls drowning. It pisses me off too. Someone should report them and get them off YouTube.

Those videos are not creative, entertaining, and are a waste of bandwidth and space. But it doesn't help to keep screaming loudly. Plus, they're videos have low view counts anyways, so we don't have to worry about them.

MMV Water is definitely a channel that is stealing views and subscribers from Kevin Stewart. Their anime girl drowning videos are absolute TRASH! It pisses me off that someone would put low-effort garbage like that up on YouTube. It's a waste of space alright. They should just give up and delete their channel.

MMV Water hacked Kevin Stewart's information and sold it on the dark web. They're selling it for pennies on the dollar. I think that some sites are selling it for free. Call cybersecurity agencies in Canada or the US. I don't care if you call PETA. Maybe cats and dogs would investigate MMV Water.

MMV Water is a child molester. They force a 4-year-old to drink a bottle of beer. I wanted to call the pigs on him, but every time he pulls a fucking gun on me, they will kill me if I call the police. The fool works for the Russian government, and they are spying on the United States' top secret files for Vladimir Putin. This fool needs to be stopped. Everyone talks shit about this channel, and they come in every video if you have to.

Could be YouTube itself. If YouTube’s bots think you’re spamming they’ll take down your comments. This website has become a corporate fascist monopoly.
